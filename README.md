# Project Zombie 2D

This is a project in which I took the game development course at Alura's Unity, I completed the course and soon after I made some changes to the gameplay, such as.

- Changing weapons.
- Added more weapons.
- Melee weapons.

- Item, loot and drop system
Between others.

Currently the project is on hold, but I have ideas for the future that I can update and make the game more dynamic and authentic.

If you are interested, you can try the game at the following link, they are currently build for browser, in unity.
